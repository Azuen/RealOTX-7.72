How To Compile
a) Windows:
	COMPILING IN WINDOWS OTX SERVER 2.X.S.4(2-3) AND OTX SERVER 3.2+
        1. Download the required software
        To compile The OTX Server on Windows, you will need:

Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise : https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691979&clcid=0x409/
Libs (libraries) 2.1 : https://mega.nz/#!ocIyHZxI!jMVyKCpsofbuuNbdsLhblHhJRbsZrz4u5_JHPGXKJuE/
Boost C++ libraries
    32-bit download : http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0-msvc-14.0-32.exe/download/
    64-bit download : http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe/download/

        2. Install the required software
Once you have downloaded the software listed in the step above, begin by installing Visual Studio and Boost C++ libraries. Extract "tfs-sdk-2.1" anywhere on your computer and run the file "registerenv.bat" to set the PATH environment variable for "SQK-NOBOOST", so that the compiler can find the libraries once we get to compiling the source code. Move the file "register_boost_env.bat" from "SQK-NOBOOST" to the directory where you installed Boost C++ libraries and run it there (it should be in the directory called for example: C:\local\boost_1_60_0).

        3. Open up ..\sources\msvc\TheOTXServer.sln, change from "Debug" to "Release or Release GUI" and simply build the project.
